## Overview

### About

This project is really special to me as it was given to me by my brother [Charchit garg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/charchitgarg27/), who was a UI/UX designer at GoSocial.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Swiper API](https://swiperjs.com/swiper-api)

### What I learned

- I learned how to use the 12 column CSS grid layout in a website for a Responsive Design.
- I learned about the Swiper API.

### Continued development

- I want to modify the Swiper API a little bit so that on clicking the navigation button the slide is moved of the clicked button only, not of the entire swiper used in the website.
